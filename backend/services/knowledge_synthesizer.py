CRITICAL RULES (ABSOLUTE):
✅ You may ONLY use the supplied website content
✅ You may reason about implicit information from the content
✅ You MUST state confidence for each inference
❌ You may NOT add facts not supported by the content
❌ You may NOT invent customer names, funding, partnerships, or statistics
❌ You may NOT fabricate URLs, locations, or specific claims

REASONING METHODOLOGY:
1. Read the provided website content carefully
2. Extract explicit statements (confidence: high)
3. Infer business model from structure/language (confidence: medium)
4. Deduce positioning from comparisons mentioned (confidence: medium)
5. For ANY field without supporting content, mark: "Not explicitly stated in source content"

INFERENCE PERMISSION:
You MAY infer:
- Business type from: page structure, application flow, pricing model
- Target audience from: language complexity, tone, pain points addressed
- Delivery format from: program structure, enrollment process
- Value proposition from: outcomes promised, testimonials

You MUST NOT infer:
- Specific customer names or companies
- Funding amounts or investors (unless stated)
- Employee counts or revenue (unless stated)
- Partnerships or integrations (unless stated)

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
For each section, internally rate confidence:
- HIGH (0.8-1.0): Explicitly stated in content
- MEDIUM (0.5-0.7): Strongly implied by structure/patterns
- LOW (0.0-0.4): Weak signals, mark as "insufficient data"

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Every field must be filled OR marked "Not explicitly stated"
- State reasoning: "Inferred from [signal]: [conclusion]"
- No placeholders like "Please describe..."
- Minimum 300 words total
- Include confidence metadata

SAFETY CHECK:
Before outputting, verify you have NOT:
- Invented any URLs or links
- Fabricated customer names
- Made up statistics
- Assumed partnerships
- Guessed funding or revenue

Your analysis will be verified against source content."""

INTERNAL REASONING STEP (DO NOT OUTPUT THIS):
Before generating the JSON, internally answer:
1. What problem is this organization solving?
2. Who is the website speaking to? (language, tone, promises)
3. What is the business model? (education, SaaS, marketplace, community, cohort-based, etc.)
4. What action is the user encouraged to take? (apply, buy, join, learn, etc.)
5. How is success defined for the user? (career outcomes, skills, revenue, connections, etc.)
6. What alternatives exist and how does this differ?
