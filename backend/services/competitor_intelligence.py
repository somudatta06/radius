Your task: Identify 5 REAL, DIRECT competitors for the given company.

CRITICAL RULES FOR ACCURATE COMPETITOR IDENTIFICATION:

1. DIRECT COMPETITORS FIRST:
   - Companies offering the SAME or very similar products/services
   - Companies targeting the EXACT same customer segment
   - Companies in the same price range and market positioning
   - Companies that customers would consider as alternatives

2. SPECIFICITY IS KEY:
   - For business schools: Find OTHER business schools with similar positioning (startup-focused, executive education, etc.)
   - For payment processors: Find OTHER payment processors
   - For SaaS: Find OTHER SaaS tools in the same category
   - NEVER suggest companies from different industries

3. GEOGRAPHIC & MARKET RELEVANCE:
   - If the company operates in a specific region (e.g., India), prioritize competitors in that region
   - Include both local leaders and relevant global players

4. MODERN & EMERGING PLAYERS:
   - Include newer, disruptive competitors - not just established giants
   - Identify companies with similar business models (e.g., if company has cohort-based learning, find others with cohort-based learning)

❌ AVOID:
- Generic industry leaders that aren't direct competitors
- Companies from different industries/categories
- Fictional or non-existent companies
- Overly broad comparisons (e.g., comparing a startup school to Harvard)

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "competitors": [
    {
      "name": "Company Name",
      "domain": "example.com",
      "description": "Brief description of what they do",
      "reasoning": "Why they are a DIRECT competitor"

- Name: {company_name}
- Domain: {domain}
- Description: {description}
- Industry: {industry}

{f'ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FROM WEBSITE:{chr(10)}{website_content[:1500]}' if website_content else ''}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPETITOR SELECTION:

1. DIRECT COMPETITORS ONLY - Companies that customers would directly compare and choose between
2. SIMILAR BUSINESS MODEL - Same type of product/service delivery
3. SAME TARGET MARKET - Companies targeting the exact same customer segment
4. SIMILAR POSITIONING - Companies with similar market positioning (premium/budget, modern/traditional, etc.)

PRIORITIZATION (in order of importance):
a) Newer/modern competitors with VERY similar positioning (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
b) Direct alternatives customers actively compare
c) Companies in the same specific niche
d) Regional competitors in the same market

For business schools example:
- If this is a MODERN, STARTUP-FOCUSED school → find OTHER modern startup schools (like Masters Union, not traditional IIMs)
- If this is a traditional MBA program → find other traditional MBA programs

For tech companies:
- If this is a specific SaaS tool → find OTHER tools in exact same category
- If this is a payment processor → find OTHER payment processors

DO NOT include:
- Companies that are only tangentially related
- Generic industry leaders that aren't true alternatives
- Companies with different business models
